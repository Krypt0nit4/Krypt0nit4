- Hi, I’m @Krypt0nit4. I live in Puerto Rico, and I decided to start learning to code with the hope of fiding a job in the field in a couple of years.
- I’m interested in learning marketable skills so I can leverage them to make money while creating interesting and valuable things for the clients or company that contracts my services.
- I’m currently enrolled in the Full-Stack enginner course of Codecademy and It has been an awesome learning experience.
